# Laboratory Assignment 2
This project covers various functionalities using Jupyter Notebook and aims to demonstrate proficiency in NumPy and SciPy libraries.


# NumPy Tasks
### 1. Generate a matrix of size NÃ—M where:

N is the serial number of a student in the list.
M is the serial number of the first letter of the student's surname in the alphabet.

### 3. Calculate the mean and median of the array.

### 4. Visualize the array using the matplotlib library.

### 5. Nullify certain values in the array and replace them (based on student choice criteria).

### 6. Normalize the array.

# SciPy Tasks
### 1. Process an image of size not less than 600x600 pixels.
Use matplotlib to visualize the image processing steps.

### 2. Enhance the image contrast by setting the minimum and maximum color values.

### 3. Separate the original image into its color components.

### 4. Convert the color image into black and white.

### 5. Blur the image.

### 6. Implement edge detection.
